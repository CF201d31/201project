    <!-- Mimosa- Composed of one part champagne and one part chilled citrus juice, this drink is what you need to get your weekend funday kick-off. Traditionally served in a tall champagne flute, this brunch favorite will provide you a free-pass to get the party started early before noon! -->
    <!-- Jack and Coke- You've been through some tough obstacles this week, and this whiskey and cola mix is just what you need to dial down. The strength and acquired taste of the whiskey is drowned in ten ounces of cola, just enough to momentarily drown your troubles away.-->
    <!-- Margarita- The sun is out and right now an outdoor meal is calling. A margarita is just what you need to unwind! Consisting of tequila, triple sec, and lime juice, this drink can be served frozen or on the rocks.-->
